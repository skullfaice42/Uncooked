here are the rules, do not disobey the rules

1. stay in your section
    - meaning dont work on others html files without asking,
      this could really mess up their flow

2. use class tags that coralate with your page
    -for example, if you are working on the home page, your tags should
     end with hp (or something like that), this way when you commit, we 
     wont have to worry about MERGE CONFLICT. 

    -nobody wants to deel with that because it would mess with our flow
    so please make sure to add something indicating that your 
    css is yours

3. renaming images
    -if you plan on renaming the images, ask before doing so. 
    make sure everybody is alright with it, because if not then it could
    mess them up (idk, just talkin' at this point)

4. renaming anything
    -ask before doing so, that way images wont be broken
